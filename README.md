Spring 2019 Portfolio

This project has brought me such joy as - essentially - a JS playground. At the time I began, I was listening to a lot of Bowie ('Ziggy Stardust') and spending time with family, which led to Nintendo reminiscing. The result is this fun amalgamation of outer-space/Game Boy/claymation. // I really thought I was 'done' with this project (ha! hahahahaha), but it turns out there was a little more 'stardust' to be applied - now that's it's gone full space capsule it's complete(?)

I have become more interested in art direction re: responsive images as a result of working through this project.

I am in process with my next portfolio iteration, which I think will involve CSS Grid.
